# ParisApartment_price_prediction_science
The goal of this pet-project was to collect data from open sources using web-scraping methods and to pick up the most suitable ML-model to predict price of an apartment in Paris.
This project is more "scientific" - I tried to work closly with 'raw' data and to analyze distinction in metrics while different Ml-models using. 

This project consists of 3 python notebooks and folder with data:  
Bienici_API_requests.ipynb - notebook with data web-scraping methods;  
EDA.ipynb - notebook with data preprocessing and analysis;  
Model_training.ipynb - notebook with ML-model selection;  
/data - folder with raw (got with Bienici_API_requests.ipynb) and processed data

Also you can get acquainted with my second project where using the same data I built the service (full cycle production - backend with FastApi + frontend with Streamlit + Docker compose) to predict prices for apartments in Paris.
